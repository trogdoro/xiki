> Preparation
1. Install xsh (Xiki Shell) if you haven't yet.

http://xiki.com/.install

2. Have a shell terminal window open, to type into while doing the tutorial steps.
3. Follow the numbered steps below.

Only the numbered steps say things you need to do. Everything else is
just explanatory.

- The web version of this tutorial is available here:
http://xiki.com/@xiki/tutorial

- Chat with us as you're doing the tutorial here:
https://gitter.im/trogdoro/xiki

- What if I don't use bash?:
If you use another shell like zsh, just assume "zsh" where the
tutorial says "bash".


> Getting in and out of xsh
Xsh (short for Xiki Shell) has many ground-breaking features. It turns
your terminal into a search engine. It makes shell commands
interactive. It creates UIs for shell commands and other tools and
databases. But let's begin with how xsh improves the basic shell
terminal experience!

1. Make sure you're in your shell terminal at an empty bash prompt.
2. Type "xsh" then type return.

$ xsh

You are now in xsh.

3. Press Ctrl+Q to quit.

You're now back in bash. Xsh is meant to complement bash rather than
replace it. So, you'll often quickly jump into xsh and then out of it.


> Keyboard shortcuts on the screen
Xsh shows the key shortcuts right on the screen! So you don't have to
memorize them like in traditional shells.

1. Type "xsh" in bash again (and return), to go back into xsh.
2. Observe the keyboard shortcuts at the bottom of the screen.

The underlined letters indicate Ctrl shortcuts. Ctrl+O for Open.
Ctrl+G for Go. Ctrl+Q for Quit, etc. Clicking on them shows
descriptions (if mouse support is enabled). You can type these key
shortcuts even when they don't appear on the screen.

All of the keys except for the last 3 work in bash as well as in xsh.
We'll start with Ctrl+O, the most used key in Xiki (it's kind of like
double-clicking). Then we'll cover Ctrl+G and a couple others.

3. Press Ctrl+Q to quit and go back to bash.
4. Now press Ctrl+O. It's a shortcut for opening xsh, when on an empty bash prompt.


- Troubleshooting:
If you didn't select "default setup" while setting up xsh, bash key
shortcuts might not be enabled. You can run "xsh --help" in bash to
see the command line equivalents of each key shortcut.


> Just type letters to filter command output
In xsh, it's easy to filter the output of shell commands. Just type a
couple letters after the command runs! In traditional shells you have
to pipe to grep, which is slow and tedious.

1. Press Ctrl+Q to go back to bash.
2. Type "cd /" and return, to change to your root directory.
3. Type "ls" but don't type return (the "l" is a lowercase L).
4. Now, press Ctrl+O. It opens xsh and runs the command.

When you see "A-Z Filter" in the bottom bar, it means you can type
letters to filter.

5. Type "bi" to incrementally filter down to only lines that contain "bi".

When "A-Z Filter" isn't showing, the letter keys are for typing stuff,
since everything is editable in xsh.

- Tip:
You can press esc while filtering to start over. Then you can type
some letters to filter again.


> Shell commands are interactive
Xsh makes command output into an interactive interface! For the "ls"
command, this means you can navigate directories and files visibly.
Instead of having to type a bunch of "ls" and "cd" commands.

1. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor back to the "$ ls" line.
2. Press Ctrl+O to collapse it.
3. Press Ctrl+O again to open it (run it).

The bottom bar shows "A-Z Filter" again, so we can type letters to
filter.

4. Type "etc" to filter down to "etc".
5. Press return to open the "etc" dir.
6. Type "ho" to filter again.
7. Move the cursor to "hosts".

Later we'll see how xsh makes
all kinds of shell commands interactive, not just "ls".

- Tip, Ctrl+O vs return:
Ctrl+O runs commands and opens things. Whereas return usually inserts
linebreaks. But when "A-Z Filter" is visible, return is similar to
Ctrl+O. Double-clicking also acts like Ctrl+O (if mouse support is
enabled).


> Use your favorite text editor
Xsh integrates with your favorite text editor.

1. With the cursor on the "hosts" line, press Ctrl+O to open it.

You're now viewing the /etc/hosts file with xsh. Now we'll use your
editor.

2. Press esc to return to the last view.
3. Press Ctrl+G ("Go" in the bottom bar). This will go to "hosts" in your default editor.

Xiki uses the editor specified in the "EDITOR" bash environment
variable. You can set it to your favorite editor if you haven't yet
(be sure to reload via "xsh --reload" in bash afterwards). If it's not
set, xsh defaults to "nano" on linux or "TextEdit" on mac.

Now let's quit our text editor and go back to bash.

4. If xsh is still open, press Ctrl+Q (xsh stays open in the terminal for graphical editors).
5. Type whatever is necessary to quit your text editor (Ctrl+X quits nano).

Later we'll show how to use your favorite text editor to create and
edit interactive notes with shell commands, and run them in xsh.

- Tip, if you get into trouble:
You can try esc to go to the previous view, or Ctrl+Z to undo.


> Persistent scratchpad for commands and notes
In bash, you can always go back to the last place you were in xsh. Just press
Ctrl+G at an empty bash prompt. In this way, xsh acts like a persistent
scratchpad, that you can jump in and out of.

1. In bash, press Ctrl+G to go back to the last place you were.
2. Move the cursor to the top left corner.
3. Type "The hosts file", then press return, just as a little note for yourself.
4. Move the cursor to the bottom and type some other words.

In xsh, everything is editable! You can type anywhere. In traditional
shells, you can only type at the single lowest prompt. When you leave
xsh, it automatically saves the current view (and remembers the
current directory).

Ctrl+G works in both directions. When on a shell command in xsh, it
goes to bash and runs the command.

5. Move the cursor to the "$ ls" line, and press Ctrl+G.
6. Press Ctrl+G to go back to xsh, to the last place you were.
7. Move to the "etc/" line, and press Ctrl+G to go to bash and cd to this dir.

Later we'll explore going back to any previous interaction, via "xsh -i"
from bash. And turning interactions into more permanent notes.


> Optional mouse support
There is optional mouse support. Don't be overly concerned if it's not
enabled for your terminal or xsh configuration. It's completely
optional. Advanced xsh users rarely use it.

1. Press Ctrl+G to go back to where we were in xsh.
2. Double-click on the "$ ls" line to collapse it.
3. Double-click on it again to rerun it. (Double-clicking is just like Ctrl+O.)
4. Try clicking around to position the cursor.

Clicking on the words in the bottom bar shows descriptions of what each
key does.

5. Click on "Open" in the bottom bar.
6. Click on "Go" in the bottom bar.
7. Click on the "x" at the right of the bottom bar, to close the view.

- Tip:
If mouse support isn't enabled, you can press Ctrl+\ to see the
descriptions. Or see the following link.

<- bar


> Interactive notes by topic
Xsh lets you create interactive notes! Notes can be anything you
want. They can be as simple as a shell command or two and maybe a
description. They can even be powerful, lightweight user interfaces
for shell commands and other API's (more on this later). Xiki
encourages you to organize your notes into topics.

1. Press Ctrl+Q to go back to bash.
2. Press Ctrl+X to list your Xiki topics.

Each topic is just a text file in the "~/xiki/" directory. They
contain your notes. The topics you see were created when you installed
xsh, to get you started. Topics you create will get added to the top
of this list. Topics use a simple wiki-ish syntax, and can be created
and edited with any text editor.

3. Type "di" to filter down to the "disk" topic.
4. Press Ctrl+G to go to the topic file (this time in xsh).

Notice the bottom bar shows you're in the "~/xiki/disk.xiki"
file. The lines with gray backgrounds are note headings. They separate
each note. Headings are just lines that start with "> ". The "> "might
be hard to see in some terminals.


> Quickly accessing your notes
It's a bit overwhelming seeing all the notes in a topic at
once. Seeing just the note names would be easier. Especially for
topics with a lot of notes. Say, 100 or more.

1. Press Ctrl+Q to go back to bash.
2. Press Ctrl+X list your Xiki topics.
3. Type "di" to filter to "disk".
4. Press return, to lists the notes in the topic.
5. Press return, to open the "Space available" note.
6. Press return, to run the command.

Those three returns could have been Ctrl+O's instead. The only
difference is that return hides the other items before it opens.

You could've also typed "disk space" then Ctrl+X at an empty bash
prompt, then pressed return twice. That would show the "disk" topic
and filter down to notes containing the word "space".

- Just text files:
Creating notes is as simple as creating a text file (or adding stuff
to an existing text file). But before we do that, let's check out some
notes created by other xsh users!


> Search engine in the terminal
Xsh turns your terminal into a search engine! Just type a search term
at the bash prompt and press Ctrl+S. It's quicker and less distracting
than copying and pasting commands from web searches.

1. Press Ctrl+Q to go back to bash.
2. Type "processes", but don't type return.
3. Press Ctrl+S to search.

The search results are notes that have been shared by other xsh users.

4. Type "cp" to filter to the "Processes taking up cpu" search result.
5. Press return open it up.
6. Press Ctrl+O to run the shell command in it.

You could have also typed "processes cpu" and then Ctrl+S at the bash
prompt.

You can search via the web interface as well.
http://xiki.com

This url shows the same results as your search for "processes".
http://xiki.com/processes

All your notes are private by default. Sharing is still in private
beta, but will be available to all xsh users soon.


> Creating notes
Let's create a very simple note.

1. Press Ctrl+Q to go back to bash.
2. Type "echo" on the bash prompt, but don't press return.
3. Press Ctrl+G to go to the topic file.

It's blank since it doesn't exist yet. Notice the file path in the
bottom bar.

4. Type the following text.
  | > Username
  | $ echo $USER

5. Press Ctrl+Q to return to bash (xsh will autosave).
6. Press Ctrl+X to list your topics.

You can see your new topic is there, with the note inside. It's at the
top, since it's the most recently updated file. You could have
accomplished the same thing by creating "~/xiki/foo.xiki" with any
text editor, and typing that stuff.


> Git log
Let's use xsh to easily navigate our git log!

First let's create an example repository. If we look in our "git"
topic, we'll find a note that came with xsh that creates example
repositories. It's helpful when doing little experiments with git.

1. In bash, type "cd" and return, to switch to your home dir.
2. Type "git" in bash, but don't press return.
3. Press Ctrl+X to list your "git" Xiki notes.

Notice the "+ create example repository" note. It has "+ " at the
beginning because it's an action (a special note that runs something
when you open it). To create an action, just put a dot at the
beginning of its name (eg. "> .Foo").

4. Press return, and the action will clone a repo and its branches and cd into it.
5. Type "git log" in bash, then Ctrl+O to open it in xsh. Xsh makes it interactive.
6. Use Ctrl+O to open one or more of the commits to see the diffs.


> Git branches
Now let's try switching between branches. This time we'll type "git"
and filter down to "branch" (though we could type "git branch"
directly if we wanted to).

1. Press Ctrl+Q, then "git" and Ctrl+O to open it in xsh.
2. Type "br" and then press return to expand the "branch..." line.
3. Open the "reasonable" branch (Ctrl+O) and open "* switch to".

You can see that we've switched branches.

4. Move your cursor down to an empty line, and press Ctrl+R to show recent commands.
5. Type "lo" to narrow to "git log", then press return.

You'll see there are "reasonable" commits in this branch. You can open
them to see the diffs if you want.


> Web browser
Let's use xsh to run html in the web browser. Skip this section if
you're using xsh via ssh or docker (if you can't start up a web
browser from the shell).

1. In bash, type "html/" (including the slash) and Ctrl+O.

The slash on the end tells xsh to run a special action that shows
snippets of html in the browser.

2. Press Ctrl+O to run the HTML in the browser.
3. In xsh, type "Updated" after "Sample", and press Ctrl+O again.

You can see your change reflected in the browser. By default, a new
tab is opened each time. This can be avoided by installing a dependency
that lets xsh have full control of the browser. See the following link
for how to do this.

<- xsh/browser control


> Notes with web examples
Now let's say we forgot (or just don't know) how to make a div with
rounded corners in css.

1. Press Ctrl+Q to return to bash.
2. Type "css corners" then Ctrl+S, to search everyone's shared notes.
3. Press Ctrl+O to open "Rounded corners (border-radius)".
4. Press Ctrl+X to expose the note, so we can run it in place.

(Alternately we could have pressed Ctrl+O and navigated to the topic
file.)

5. Press Ctrl+O to open it in the browser.

You can change some of the values and press Ctrl+O again. You could
also try searching for "bootstrap", "d3", "threejs", "fontawesome" or
"react" to run some examples.


> SQLite
Let's interact with some database tables. First let's create a couple
sample tables, using a note that was installed by default to help you
do the tutorial. (In the future you can use Ctrl+S to search for other
notes for your own use, and install them so they'll be convenient to
access.)

1. In bash, type "sqlite3", then Ctrl+X to show your Xiki notes for sqlite3.
2. Press Ctrl+O to run "create sample tables and records".
3. Move down to "tables" and press Ctrl+O to see the tables.

You could type "sqlite3/tables" and Ctrl+X in bash to go directly to
the "tables" action. But there's a "tables" topic to make it even
quicker.

4. In bash, type "tables/" (including the slash) and Ctrl+X.

The slash at the end means to run the "slash action" for the
topic. Slash actions are special notes that let topics optionally
behave like actions.

5. Press Ctrl+O to expand one of the tables.
6. Type some letters to filter down to a record.
7. Edit the person's name, and press Ctrl+O to save back to the db.

You can also type "sqlite3/" in bash and then Ctrl+X. This lets you
run sql statements.
