> Try it out
- 1) Add this line, and then restart vim
  ~/.vimrc
    | let $XIKI_DIR = "[xiki dir]"
    | source [xiki dir]/etc/vim/xiki.vim

- 2) Type "ip" on a blank line and double-click on it


> If your vim version doesn't have ruby enabled
The standard macvim download has the ruby.  Compile vim with the --enable-rubyinterp flag installed.


> What's implemented
Just double-clicking on one line and shelling out to 'xiki'
and inserting the results


> What needs to be implemented
- Making this work for nested paths, like:
docs/
  - faq/
- It needs to climb the path and pass it in to the command
- Making it collapse when the line underneath it is indented lower
- Making it incrementally search after commands are inserted
  - is there a command in vim to read 1 char from the user?


> Help out
Join the xiki google group if you want to help implement this.

If you're in the bay area, hit me up and we can meet at a coffee shop and pair on wraping it up!
