- Introduction/
  | Most of the Xiki documentation is spread out among other menus, under
  | their respective 'docs' menus.

  > Here are some to check out first
  =keys/docs/
  =menu/docs/
  =files/docs/
  =view/docs/
- Try typing stuff/
  > Try just typing a word
  | Think of a menu name that might exist and sounds likely to solve your
  | problem.  For example, if you want to do something with images, try the
  | 'images' menu.  Type it on a blank line and double-click, or use
  | open+menu (type Ctrl-O, Ctrl-M).

  | Help us improve the docs, and contribute back to the Xiki project.  If
  | the menu doesn't exist, create it!  If it exists, but could be improved,
  | edit it!  Many menus exist just to direct you to other menus.  It takes
  | only seconds to create them.

- Xiki Shell Command/
  > Summary
  The 'xiki' shell command can be run on the command line
  outside of Xiki.  It is mostly meant to be called by programs
  that want to interface with Xiki.  But it is sometimes useful for
  people to call it directly.  Example usages:

  $ xiki ip
  $ xiki docs/faq
- Xiki Web Interface/
  > Summary
  You can access most xiki menus in your browser, using this url:

  http://xiki

  > Setting it up
  See this menu for how to set it up.  Beware, it's currently
  experimental has security holes that need to be patched (blocking)
  non-priveleged users from using sensitive menus.

  Some of the more complicated menus that have editor dependencies
  will only be partially functional in the browser.
