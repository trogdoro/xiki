: What key shortcuts are like Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E and Ctrl+K in bash?
  | ^A ^A : Beginning of line
  | ^E ^E : End of line
  | ^K ^K : Kill line
  |
  : If the alt or option key is configured in your terminal...
    | You can do Alt+A, Alt+E, and Alt+K ("option" instead of "alt"
    | on the mac).
    |
    | You may need to configure your keyboard preferences in your
    | console app to make alt (or option) behave in the standard way.
    | The preference will be called something like "make alt behave
    | like escape+".
