> Things menus can return to request more info
- docs/
  - summary/
    | Menus can return "=beg/siblings/" and similar things to indicate
    | they want the Xiki client to re-invoke them with more
    | information. Normally when you launch a menu only the path is
    | sent as input (and a few other pieces of info).
    |
    | Returning something like this makes Xiki re-invoke the menu,
    | passing in the additional information (unless there's a reason
    | not to).
    |
    | See the items below for examples.
  - source/
    | Here's the start of the code that handles this:
    =/projects/xiki/lib/xiki/core/launcher.rb
      + ##if\ beg\ ==/
  - future todo maybe/
    - when colons, way to beg multiple lines, but with colons, to distinguish/
      - example/
        - when...
          : multiple
          : lines
        - would return
          ": multiple\n: lines\n"
    - have character equivalants/
      | So maybe these will be equivalent
      | =beg/quoted/
      | <?:
- quoted/
  | Menus can return "=beg/quoted/" to indicate they want to be
  | invoked again, with a big multi-line string passed in. The
  | adjoining :... lines will be included, separated by linebreaks.
  | (The colons will be striped off.)
  - example/
    =/tmp/
      - normal_behavior.rb
        : args[0].inspect
      - normal_behavior//
        : expand one of
        : these lines
      - colon_beggar.rb
        : # If not multi-line string passed in, ask for it
        : return "=beg/quoted/" if args[0] !~ /\n/
        :
        : args[0].inspect
      - colon_beggar//
        : expand one of
        : these lines
  - about pipes/
    | Note that if the lines are quoted with pipes, lines will be
    | passed in automatically as a big string automatically.
    | Example:
    =args/
      : []
      + docs/
    =echo/
      | expand one of
      | these lines
  - example/
    =~/.xiki/roots/beggar.rb
      | # Beg for multiple lines when only 1 given (check for a linebreak)
      | return "=beg/quoted/" if args[0] !~ /\n/
      |
      | "I got #{args}"
    =beggar/
      - bullet
      | quoted
      | lines
- neighbors/
  | Menus can return "=beg/neighbors/" to indicate want to be
  | invoked again with siblings passed, except for those separated
  | by blank lines.
  - example/
    =~/.xiki/roots/beggar.rb
      | # Beg for multiple lines when only 1 given (check for a linebreak)
      | return "=beg/neighbors/" if args[0] !~ /\n/
      |
      | "I got #{args}"
    =beggar/
      - bullet
      | quoted

      - separated
- siblings/
  | Menus can return "=beg/siblings/" to indicate want to be
  | invoked again, with all the siblings passed in as the last
  | argument, including ones separated by single blank lines.
  - example/
    =~/.xiki/roots/beggar.rb
      | # Beg for multiple lines when only 1 given (check for a linebreak)
      | return "=beg/siblings/" if args[0] !~ /\n/
      |
      | "I got #{args}"
    =beggar/
      - bullet
      | quoted

      - separated
