# Xiki is temporarily not set up to be used as a gem.  Just download it
# and run bin/xsh directly.
#
# Eventually xiki will be installable as a gem, so you can use xiki classes
# from ruby code, including using xiki as a rails plugin.
#
# It's unclear as of yet whether the gem install should put the xsh command
# into the path.
